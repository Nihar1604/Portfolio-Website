Personal Portfolio Webpage
This repository contains the source code for a responsive personal portfolio website built for the freeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" certification. It is a fully responsive, single-page site designed to showcase skills and projects while successfully passing all user stories of the freeCodeCamp test suite.

The page features a welcome section, a grid of key projects, and multiple contact links for professional networking. Its primary purpose is to serve as a demonstration of competence against a recognized educational standard and as a central hub for my professional work.

Technology Stack
This project was built using foundational web technologies, with a focus on a clean, "zero-build" setup for maximum portability and ease of review. The following details the technologies used and their specific roles within the project

Technology	Category	Role in Project

HTML5	- Provides the core structure and semantic meaning of the webpage content, utilizing tags like nav , main and section for accessibility and organization.
CSS3 -	Handles all visual presentation, including layout (Flexbox/Grid), responsive design via media queries, typography, and color schemes.
JavaScript - Used exclusively by the freeCodeCamp test suite (bundle.js) to programmatically validate that all project requirements and user stories are met.
Google Fonts	-	Imports the 'Poppins' and 'Raleway' font families to create a modern and clean aesthetic for headings and body text.
Font Awesome	-	Provides scalable vector icons for social media and contact links (e.g., GitHub, email), enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the contact section.

Features
The portfolio is designed with user experience in mind, incorporating several key features:

Fixed Navigation: A navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the viewport for easy access, allowing for smooth scrolling to the "Welcome," "Work," and "Contact" sections of the page.

Dynamic Project Grid: The "Work" section displays a responsive grid of project tiles. Hovering over a tile reveals the project's name and the technologies used, providing context at a glance.

Seamless External Linking: All external links, including those for live project demos and social media profiles, are configured to open in a new browser tab (target="_blank"). This is a deliberate UX choice to ensure visitors can explore external content without navigating away from the portfolio, maintaining a seamless browsing experience.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and adapts gracefully to a wide range of devices, from large desktop monitors to small mobile screens, ensuring a consistent and accessible experience for all users.


Future Enhancements
This project is actively maintained. The following is a roadmap of planned improvements:

[ ] Replace placeholder projects with my 3 most recent works, including updated screenshots and descriptions.

[ ] Implement a theme-switcher for light/dark mode using CSS custom properties and a small amount of JavaScript.

[ ] Animate section content on scroll using the Intersection Observer API to enhance visual engagement.
